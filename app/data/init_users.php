<b>Problem:</b> <br>
At medical facilities a common way of communication is through pagers. Doctors and
 other medical staff will page each other when needed for a certain room number
  and at times they will call if no one arrives in a certain amount 
  of time or an emergency. Hospitals are now incorporating higher level
   technology such as the IPad in order to fill out documents for
    the patients and to look at the hospital database of who is in, 
    what they are in for, and the nurse who is in charge of that patient. 
    What will happen is employees such as the interpreters will be in a room 
    or in the office and will get a page, unable to answer the phone call that
     they’ll receive in 10 min all they can do is hang up because they are usually working with a patient at the moment.
     <br>
     <b>Solution:</b> <br>
     Developed a web app, in which the doctors can login to the system, select available interpreters and make a 
     request. The interpreter will then pick the request and send an ETA to the doctor.

 Worked with Apache Spark, and visualization techniques to compare hospital dataset provided by <a target='_blank' href='https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare'>https://data.medicare.gov/data/hospital-compare</a> 

These data allow us to compare the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals across the country. This data also can be used by the hospital is visualized properly to improve their quality of care.
Using the above mentioned dataset we compared hospitals based on the below mentioned use cases: 
<ul><li>
Complications: Patients admitted to the hospital for treatment of one medical problem sometimes get other serious injuries or complications, and may even die. Hospitals can often prevent these events by following best practices for treating patients.
</li><li>
Readmission and death: These quality measures show how often patients who are hospitalized for certain conditions experience serious problems soon after they are discharged. Some patients may need to be admitted to the hospital again, and some patients may even die. Also we plan to see and compare the Readmission reduction. 
</li><li>
	Survey of patients' experiences: Hospital CAHPS®, is a standardized survey instrument and data collection methodology that has been in use since 2006 to measure patients' perspectives of hospital care. We will get this data and will try to compare with the overall star ratings for the hospital.

<ul>
<li>UNCC NextRide is a revamp of UNCC’s existing bus tracking application for students to commute to classes. Students use this app to know the exact location of the bus and the time it takes to reach the boarding point. </li>
<li>UNCC NextRide is a GPS feed that provides Campus Shuttle and SafeRide tracking on a map with arrival predictions, schedules and service alerts. Routes, schedules, arrivals and bus movement can be seen in real time, in one place.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Issues with the current app:
</b>
<ul>
<li>The first screen shows all the available buses. New students who are unaware of all the bus routes will have a hard time figuring out which bus to board.
</li><li>Choosing 'Details' of a specific bus shows a table of bus stops and time remaining. It is inappropriate to show all the bus stops and time remaining.
</li><li>It's confusing to see 2 occurances of the same stops, because the bus keeps going to and fro.
</li><li>The Map on the Home screen does not convey a user's basic expectations:
</li><li>The user's current location
</li><li>The time that the bus takes to reach the user's boarding point.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<b>Solutions:
</b>
<ul>
<li> Allows users to their boarding and destination points. Locations services are not mandatory because the users are allowed to choose their boarding points. 
</li><li> Shows only the relavant search results. Show the number of buses available and their respective times to arrive 
</li><li>Shows the location of the bus at that time as well as the user's current location on a top-down 2D map with the time remaining for the bus to arrive at the boarding point. 
Enabling Alert helps students to notify 1 minute before the bus arrives.</li>
